Mark,Davis,SteelGlide,President,"Janet is an outstanding senior engineer and consummate professional. She joined our team as a Senior Software Engineer. Thanks to her exceptional performance as a designer, developer, and mentor, she rose quickly to a technical leadership role in the company. I've never met anyone as broadly talented in software technology. But the icing on the cake is her ability to work with others. She's a naturally empathetic person, able to encourage and challenge those around her to learn and grow professionally and personally. She is an asset to any organization, and given the chance I'd hire her in a second.","02/10/25, 07:02 PM",VISIBLE

She is also incredibly helpful and eager to teach what she knows to others.   I could give the usual platitudes about quality work, delivering on time, etc. Those are all true, but I can say those things about a lot of great people I've worked with. Yona goes far beyond that. She radiates a genuine positive attitude of cheerfulness and enthusiasm that lifts the spirits of everyone fortunate enough to work with her.","08/01/23, 12:39 PM",VISIBLE
Jacques,Fournier,Catallactic Valuation LLC,Managing Member/Certified General Appraiser,"I had the great privilege of working with Ms. Jeffus at RealQuantum from 2022-2023.  She was the most experienced engineer on our team and as a result, was responsible for some of the most important and complex assignments, such as implementation of single sign-on (SSO) using Auth0 and Azure.  She was also extremely enthusiastic about helping others with any problem, doing flawless deployments, and leading our team meetings.  She would be a great asset to any team, including as lead developer or CTO, and I hope that I have the opportunity to work with her again in the future.","05/22/23, 08:05 PM",VISIBLE
